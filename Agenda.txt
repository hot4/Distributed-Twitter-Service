To Do
-----
- Create Class
	- User
		- Functions:
			- sendTweet(Tweet, Ti): Creates a PartialLog of events the receiver is not aware about and sends tweet, Ti, and PartialLog to all User's who are not blocked by this User
			- view(): Display all tweets (User, Message, Time) in UTC order from most recent to oldest with current TimeZone. Ignore tweets from Users this User knows have blocked it.
			- block(userName): Takes a userName as input. Adds this user to list of blocked users. Add block event to log that will be sent out with next tweet.
			- unblock(userName): Takes a userName as input. Removes this user from the list of blocked users. Add unblock event to log that will be sent out with next tweet.
			- onEvent(): Increment cI, update Ti(i,i) value, create eR, and add eR to Log
			              - If it's a tweet, create Tweet object and call sendTweet()
			- hasRecv(T, eR, j): Checks whether or not, receipient User, j, has received event record, eR by checking T, a matrix of direct and indirect knowledge this User is aware of
			- onRecv(Tweet, PartialLog, Tk): Updates this User's log, BlockedView (User's who have blocked this User), and MatrixT
		- Fields:
			- UserName: Unique identifier
			- TimeZone: Represents location specific time; i.e. EST. Used to convert to convert the tweet times to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
			- BlockedUsers: A list of Users this User has blocked
			- UnblockedUsers: A list of Users this User has not blocked
			- BlockedViews: A list of Users this User cannot view tweets
			- Tweets: A list of Tweets this User has received
			- Ci: Amount of events that have causaully occurred on this User
			- MatrixT: An NxN matrix represnting direct and indirect knowledge of other matrices

		- Functions:
		- Fields:

				- Message: The text of the tweet
